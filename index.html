		<div class="show p1 w-1of1">Consumerism</div>
		<div class="show text p2 w-1of1">All over the place, from the popular culture to the propaganda system, there is constant pressure to make people feel that they are helpless, that the only role they can have is to ratify decisions and to consume.</div>
		<div class="show text p3 w-1of1">Consumerism is a way of life and an ideology which is developed further by mass phenomenon. In Singapore, consumerism has become very much a way of life with the popular Great Singapore Sale, major IT Exhibitions, perpetual discounts in most retail outlets nations wide and many delicious restaurants with culture involved. Thus, it is important for us to recognize the value of consumerism that is within and around us. People are consuming in different aspects, and Food & Beverage is taking a big part in the society. However, people need to consume, people consume also because of the thousands of designed space which attract them to go and explore more for their life. In another word, consumerism is becoming design driven. According to dictionary, the meaning of consumerism is that the movement seeking to protect and inform consumers by requiring such practices as honest packaging and advertising, product guarantees, and improved safety standards; the theory that a progressively greater consumption of goods is economically beneficial; and attachment to materialistic values or possessions: deplored the rampant consumerism of contemporary society.</div>
		<div class="show text p4">Consumerism is known as an action where people purchase goods, which are more than necessary for their lives, but it can affect more than buying habits and personal and family life. Sometimes, it may even make people less aware of their own emotional reactions, as they seek to buy yet another item that will distract them. On the other hand, consumerism also keeps people up-to-date and modern as consumerism globalized.</div>
		<div class="show text p5">In fact, consumerism has been around human civilization at the first place. It had a great turn in consumerism arrived just before the Industrial Revolution.</div>
		<div class="show text p6">In 21st century, consumerism is one of the arguments of scientists, and researchers, they try to find out how and why do people waste money in such expensive things, such as clothing, electronic items, cars, technological devices ...etc. One of many reasons that makes consumer spend lots of money for their consumption is advertisement. According to research, Billions of companies throw their commercials into market as many ways as they can. They will show their brand names on TV, magazines, in movie theaters, malls ...etc. To attract consumer, companies have million ways to entice people by advertising. If a company wants people know about its name or products, they then try to make an attractive poster or a nice page in magazine to advertise their products to the public. Containing a nice explicit picture and attractive colors, the poster is made to send an implicit message -the key- to consumers; this key convinces people to buy products. This has become a trend internationally. Indeed, a company advertised themselves is a way of designing themselves looks better and sounds greater to sell the product.</div>
		<div class="show text p7">From a design perspective, will a good design bring more consumers to the place? The answer is definitely yes.</div>
		<div class="show text p8">Designing a place is designing an experience, and how to leave people with a memory. It is the atmosphere that provides for the customers, which has a significant impact on them, and make them want to come back and hang out.</div>
		<div class="show text p9">Moreover, consumerism is not only happened in the fashion world as motioned before, Consumerism is also applied for other industries as well. For Singapore, tourism and food & beverage are the most important industry which makes the income for the whole country. Food & beverage industry is the basic needs for people, how good the basic industry is, and it reflects how well the country has developed. In another world, the fundamental shows all. However, food & beverage is not lonely the food and drinks, it is a place where provides the feel of gathering; the atmosphere and the environment which design dress them up together. For some of Singaporeans, they consume on food & beverage as a lifestyle to eat fine food at well designed restaurants.</div>
		<div class="show text p10">Based on research from Singapore Tourism Board, the busy life that Singaporeans have, the among of tourists come to Singapore keep growing year by year and the mixed culture background, all of these determine that there is a demand to open more fine dining restaurants. Singapore especially has a strong influence of western culture, the percentage of Singaporeans who drink wine has grown over 214 present during last 10 years, so that it is a potential to open a wine shop here as well.</div>
		<div class="show text p11">As a result, the proposal for the Utopia project is to design a wine appreciation club and fine dining restaurant which aims to add on more value to the Singapore society, to adopt a wine culture to Singaporeans. According to the chosen site at South beach building which is located at the CBD area, the target market would be businessmen, tourists and local Singaporeans. The design intention is to create a space which carries the knowledge about the wine culture, the process of making wine and history of wine etc.</div>
		<div class="show text p12">The design concept is based on the process of making wine, the three key steps are harvest, crushing and ageing. The idea behind these three key words is that: harvest is a place to gather people and collection of grapes, it will become the reception and welcoming place at first when people get into the space; following by the crushing step, it is translated to the whole design language of the entire space, after reaching welcoming space, the crushing step forms a wine process gallery, normally, a gallery should be open and big space, yet in this case, in order to feel more about the crushing step of winemaking process, the space is designed to be narrow and low-volume space; Now ageing, this key word is designed as a journey in the space, why? The reason is ageing is a matter of time, a space that is changing or transforming like the wine making process, from grapes to wine, form sugar to alcohol; As people walking in the space, the space is able to speak and lead people through the designed journey. The space will be changing in term of volume, proportion, scale, lighting and different materials of the space.</div>
		<div class="show text p13">Through designing the space to bring people's attention and draw people into the place to purchase and enjoy, it is a way of consumerism. Indeed, consumers come to the place not only to dine, but to also engage with new things, to experience the space, to add on value to them, to spend time with friends in the atmosphere of wine knowledge. Leave a wonderful memory to the consumers.</div>

    <div class="hide geometer99 fs-med">Shoehorns! When I was younger I thought that shoehorns were just for old people, and also I separately hated putting on dress shoes. When I became an adult, I thought “if only there were some way to not crush the crap out of your finger when you put your dress shoes on.” Then I realized.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide sevon42 fs-small">Snuggie. Seemed the stupidest thing in the world until my now-ex-wife got us some. It’s the perfect office chair blanket. Fun little thing about stuff like this: A lot of that made for TV stuff that makes no sense is actually for handicapped people. The Snuggie, for example, was actually made for those stuck in wheelchairs. But there’s such a small market for those folks they have to convince non-handicapped folks of their usefulness as well.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide modex fs-large">Thanks for the Xmas gift ideas everyone.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide philmtl fs-med">eufy robovac, this little robot gets all the dog fur everyday and needs cleaning once a week. for 200$ its just the best value. no more dog fur on my floors</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide nameofuser217 fs-med">Coffee. I was so against drinking it and could never understand how people could base their lives and sanity around a stupid drink. Turned 30 and I tried some iced coffee and it’s been a downward slope for the past six months.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide delecti fs-med">Voice activated lights in my bedroom. I got a smart plug and “Alexa turn off the bedroom lights” means I don’t have to get out of bed when it’s time to go to sleep. My wife loves it too. I mean, how lazy do you have to be to complain about turning off the bedroom lights? Well I’m apparently that lazy.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide incognegros fs-large">Air fryer. Best kitchen appliance hands down.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide wasabipeanuts fs-med">A sharp pocket knife. Not so much the knife itself, but actually having it on me all the time. My dad always carried one and after he passed I took his knife to carry around. It’s become the most useful and relied upon tool I own, and not for sentimental reasons.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide melesana fs-med">Dryer balls. Like tennis balls that you put in the dryer along with your clothes. Your clothes dry faster and with fewer wrinkles.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide notspicyenough fs-large">Glow in the dark nail polish</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide ladytreehugger fs-small">Cell phones. I did NOT want people to be able to call me no matter where I was. Why would I want to pay an extra bill just so that other people could pester me at all times? I resisted smart phones for a while, too. These days I’m having trouble warming up to Siri and Alexa, and any of the voice-to-computer-command technologies, but I’m aware that I’ll probably find it useful if I could just get comfortable with it.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide muddymississippi fs-med">Ugg boots. I thought they were so ugly and that my step-sister was dumb for wanting so many in different colors. They’re still ugly, but holy shit are they warm and comfortable. I’ve had a pair for 7+ years now and they are easily my favorite boots ever (and durable too).</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide neverbethesky fs-med">Honestly, moisturiser. I never thought it was worth shit and that men who wore is were big girls blouses until I had really dry and tight skin one day after being outdoors in the cold and I tried it out of curiosity. I wear it every day and it’s honestly changed my life.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide shraquoia fs-med">I hesitated purchasing a Xmas tree watering device. Essentially it’s a funnel with a long tube attached to it. After one use it’s proved the 4.95 spent on cheap plastic was worth it.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide thelegendofpict fs-large">Audible. A million times Audible. Now I can’t imagine a roadtrip without it.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide jchriddy fs-small">I never had a toaster oven growing up, I got my first one when I was 30. It changed my life. Seriously. I thought they were just tiny ovens and always wondered why people owned them when a regular oven was a thing. It’s so fast to heat up and it’s got enough room to make pretty much whatever I need to make for 1-2 people. If you are cooking for 2 people or less, it should be a staple of your kitchen. I cannot say enough good things about mine. I use it almost every day and I eat so much better than I ever did before because it’s so much easier to bake a piece of chicken or make a baked potato.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide deleted fs-med">One of those wireless Dyson vacuum cleaners. I remembered my dad’s 12V car vacuum cleaner and expected the same. Holy shit that thing is a game changer.</div>

    <div contenteditable="true" class="hide dadwith2sons fs-med">Liquid smoke:) I thought liquid smoke was artificially made and would taste fake but it’s like condensed hickory smoke or something like that and it taste awesome!</div>
