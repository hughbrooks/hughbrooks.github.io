    <div class="show zoegays fs-large">Fidget spinner</div>
    <div class="show geometer99 fs-med">Shoehorns! When I was younger I thought that shoehorns were just for old people, and also I separately hated putting on dress shoes. When I became an adult, I thought “if only there were some way to not crush the crap out of your finger when you put your dress shoes on.” Then I realized.</div>
    <div class="show sevon42">Snuggie. Seemed the stupidest thing in the world until my now-ex-wife got us some. It’s the perfect office chair blanket. Fun little thing about stuff like this: A lot of that made for TV stuff that makes no sense is actually for handicapped people. The Snuggie, for example, was actually made for those stuck in wheelchairs. But there’s such a small market for those folks they have to convince non-handicapped folks of their usefulness as well.</div>
    <div class="show modex fs-large">Thanks for the Xmas gift ideas everyone.</div>
    <div class="show philmtl">eufy robovac, this little robot gets all the dog fur everyday and needs cleaning once a week. for 200$ its just the best value. no more dog fur on my floors</div>
    <div class="show nameofuser217">Coffee. I was so against drinking it and could never understand how people could base their lives and sanity around a stupid drink. Turned 30 and I tried some iced coffee and it’s been a downward slope for the past six months.</div>
    <div class="show db214">Nissan Cube</div>
    <div class="show delecti">Voice activated lights in my bedroom. I got a smart plug and “Alexa turn off the bedroom lights” means I don’t have to get out of bed when it’s time to go to sleep. My wife loves it too. I mean, how lazy do you have to be to complain about turning off the bedroom lights? Well I’m apparently that lazy.</div>
    <div class="show incognegros">Air fryer. Best kitchen appliance hands down.</div>
    <div class="show wasabipeanuts">A sharp pocket knife. Not so much the knife itself, but actually having it on me all the time. My dad always carried one and after he passed I took his knife to carry around. It’s become the most useful and relied upon tool I own, and not for sentimental reasons.</div>
    <div class="show melesana">Dryer balls. Like tennis balls that you put in the dryer along with your clothes. Your clothes dry faster and with fewer wrinkles.</div>
    <div class="show notspicyenough">Glow in the dark nail polish</div>
    <div class="show ladytreehugger">Cell phones. I did NOT want people to be able to call me no matter where I was. Why would I want to pay an extra bill just so that other people could pester me at all times? I resisted smart phones for a while, too. These days I’m having trouble warming up to Siri and Alexa, and any of the voice-to-computer-command technologies, but I’m aware that I’ll probably find it useful if I could just get comfortable with it.</div>
    <div class="show muddymississippi">Ugg boots. I thought they were so ugly and that my step-sister was dumb for wanting so many in different colors. They’re still ugly, but holy shit are they warm and comfortable. I’ve had a pair for 7+ years now and they are easily my favorite boots ever (and durable too).</div>
    <div class="show neverbethesky">Honestly, moisturiser. I never thought it was worth shit and that men who wore is were big girls blouses until I had really dry and tight skin one day after being outdoors in the cold and I tried it out of curiosity. I wear it every day and it’s honestly changed my life.</div>
    <div class="show shraquoia">I hesitated purchasing a Xmas tree watering device. Essentially it’s a funnel with a long tube attached to it. After one use it’s proved the 4.95 spent on cheap plastic was worth it.</div>
    <div class="show thelegendofpict">Audible. A million times Audible. Now I can’t imagine a roadtrip without it.</div>
    <div class="show jchriddy">I never had a toaster oven growing up, I got my first one when I was 30. It changed my life. Seriously. I thought they were just tiny ovens and always wondered why people owned them when a regular oven was a thing. It’s so fast to heat up and it’s got enough room to make pretty much whatever I need to make for 1-2 people. If you are cooking for 2 people or less, it should be a staple of your kitchen. I cannot say enough good things about mine. I use it almost every day and I eat so much better than I ever did before because it’s so much easier to bake a piece of chicken or make a baked potato.</div>
    <div class="show deleted">One of those wireless Dyson vacuum cleaners. I remembered my dad’s 12V car vacuum cleaner and expected the same. Holy shit that thing is a game changer.</div>
    <div class="show dadwith2sons">Liquid smoke:) I thought liquid smoke was artificially made and would taste fake but it’s like condensed hickory smoke or something like that and it taste awesome!</div>
